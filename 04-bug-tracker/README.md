Features:

-   Login, Register with Firebase
-   Backend Cloud Firestore
-   Add, Update, Delete bug
-   Send bug with url
-   Assign bugs to other team members

Why Firebase ?

I use firebase in this case for two reasons, the first is that I am not a backend developer and firebase is ready out of the box. the second is that firebase has Realtime database and that is good because the bugs are stored in a single collection i.e. all users can see the bugs of others and the real time a team member can see when the bug list is updated.
